Place for me to put html templates, that are the best that they can be.


##Responsive tables

Table is divided into a 20 column grid, each grid column is 5% of the width
You can set the width of any cell by adding the size-x class (from size-1 to size 20)

Each cell has a h5 that is hidden in the larger screen sizes and shown in the smaller screen sizes.
If you include the responsiveHeader section this 
will be displayerd in the large screen sizes and hidden in the smaller screen sizes
